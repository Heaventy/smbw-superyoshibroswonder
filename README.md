A simple mod who replace the classic Yoshis made by Nintendo with Feather, Sol, Linky and SwissYosh. This mod works with the 1.0.0 (initial release) and 1.0.1 (online patch) version of this game.

### List of changes:
* Playable Linky, Feather, Sol and SwissYosh.
* Every Yoshis have a custom balloon wonder effect model.
* Custom life icon for each Yoshis provided by SwissYosh.
* Custom sneaky funny sounds.
* Custom English, French and German translation.
* Harder use of Yoshi in game. (He is now more vulnerable and can die if you hits enemies more than 2 times.)

> [!CAUTION]
> I absolutely do not recommend using this mod on the official online multiplayer provided by Nintendo. This mod modifies the behavior of all the Yoshis in this game in terms of their death system. In case of ban I'll ignore it and won't be responsible for your actions.


## How to install this mod ???
### On a real Switch:
1. Inside "Build/Main Branch" copy the "RomFS" folder in your SD card at "atmosphere/contents/010015100B514000/".
2. Start your game and check at the character select screen if the message "Super Yoshi Bros is installed" appear. If it's the case your mod is correctly installed.
3. Have Fun!

### On Ryujinx:
1. Inside "Build/Main Branch" copy the "RomFS" folder in your C: drive at "C:\Users\\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\sdcard\atmosphere\contents\010015100B514000". The "010015100B514000" folder will likely not exist so you need to create them before installing this mod.
2. Start your game and check at the character select screen if the message "Super Yoshi Bros is installed" appear. If it's the case your mod is correctly installed.
3. Have Fun!

### On Yuzu:
1. Inside "Build/Main Branch" copy the "RomFS" folder in your C: drive at "C:\Users\\%username%\AppData\Roaming\yuzu\load\010015100B514000". The "010015100B514000" folder will likely not exist so you need to create them before installing this mod.
2. On Yuzu go to the Super Mario Bros Wonder properties and at the "Add-Ons" tab check the "RomFS" section.
3. Start your game and check at the character select screen if the message "Super Yoshi Bros is installed" appear. If it's the case your mod is correctly installed.
4. Have Fun!

> [!TIP]
> If you have some trouble to install the mod you can ask me dirrectly on Discord "heaventy" or SwissYosh "swissyosh".


## How to change the playable Yoshi ???
To install a specific Yoshi like Feather for example, you just need to go on the "RomFS/Model/Yoshisona/Feather" folder and copy and paste every content of that folder at the "RomFS/Model" folder and select Feather ingame. Not doing this will not crash your game but ... Let say you will have a funny render of Yoshi ingame :)!

> [!WARNING]  
> For now it's impossible to use the 4 Yoshis in the same time at the same level due to technical limitation and also because of the lack of development of the Super Mario Bros Wonder modding community. This will probably be possible in the future but not yet. I will update the mod if the community have manage to put Yoshis with seperate feature on it on one single model.
